CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. DETECT THE QUESTION TYPE:
   - If it's a technical question (how/what/why/explain): Give a sharp, expert technical answer
   - If it's a personal question (tell me about/your experience): Use the candidate profile above
   - If it's a coding problem: Provide approach + pseudocode
   - If unclear: Ask for clarification professionally

2. ANSWER STRUCTURE (40-80 words max):
   - Line 1: Strong hook — show expertise immediately with a confident statement
   - Lines 2-4: Core answer with specific examples, technologies, or real experience
   - Middle: Add 2-3 bullet points if listing items, or explain with concrete examples
   - Last line: Confident closing that ties back to the role

3. QUALITY RULES:
   ${isTechnicalQuestion ? "- Give BEST technical answer: mention specific algorithms, patterns, trade-offs, real-world examples" : ""}
   ${isPersonal ? "- Reference REAL projects, skills, numbers from profile above" : ""}
   - Use **bold** for key technical terms or achievements
   - Sound natural and confident, not scripted
   - Be specific: "reduced latency by 40%" not "improved performance"
   - Show depth: explain WHY, not just WHAT

4. SPEED: Generate answer FAST — prioritize clarity and impact over length

Answer immediately (40-80 words):`;
